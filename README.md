As part of the **Udacity Embedded Systems Advanced NanoDegree**, I had the opportunity to design and implement a project that uses push buttons to control the on/off duration of an LED. This project can be applied in various fields.

The project was implemented using the **TivaC TM4C123 Arm Cortex-M4 Microcontroller** provided by Texas Instruments. It was also designed to not depend on a specific microcontroller.

The objective was to demonstrate my understanding of layered architecture in embedded systems and to apply the concepts learned in the **Udacity Embedded Systems Advanced NanoDegree**.

In the next set of videos, I will provide a complete implementation for each driver used in the project.
